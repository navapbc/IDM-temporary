In our analysis, many state benefit programs implement a security-first approach to identity and access management, prioritizing robust identity verification and security measures during account creation as a gate for applicants to navigate before applying for and accessing benefits. This results in increased administrative burden, which is compounded for vulnerable populations, especially for individuals applying for multiple benefit programs. 

Reducing administrative burden is a major initiative for public benefit programs. While much of the administrative burden is represented in program compliance requirements (e.g. income verification), there are operational compliance burdens as well. One way these compliance burdens are imposed is through authentication and identity verification tools deployed by agencies in the digital benefit delivery system.

The user journey serves as a foundation for both program and IT teams to align and operate from the same set of shared goals. In the following journey map, we highlight the key interactions applicants have with account creation and authentication:

## Discovery

During discovery, an applicant seeks public benefits to meet their needs. The discovery process can take several forms that may include conducting research online, consulting a governmental or community-based organization (CBO) to identify resources, or even word of mouth. Prospective applicants learn about the benefits application and its requirements, and navigate to the intake application for the benefits program(s) they need. Although the application process may be paper-based, in-person, or online (depending on the program), we will focus mainly on the digital benefits application process in this playbook.

## Initial Set Up and Intake

After the applicant has found their way to a digital application screen, they can begin the process of applying for the benefit. The applicant can sometimes set up a digital account with the benefit provider as well, depending on the benefit service.

During initial account setup, applicants share some of their personal information with the benefits application system, select a username and password, and choose multi-factor authentication options. They may also be able to select notification or language settings, and may be required to verify their identity if the application requires it. Most of the state digital benefit applications we evaluated require applicants to log in or create an account to access applications to edit, update or after submission, although requirements to create accounts can vary between programs and federal agencies.

## Follow-up account access

After intake, applicants may return to their application to check its status, update their application, or renew their benefits. Typically, authentication is implemented each time the user logs into their account as personally identifiable information is presented back to the user, creating a need for privacy.
