It is critical to ground our approach in an understanding of applicants’ goals and pain points as they navigate digital account creation and authentication in the benefits application process. The applicant and caseworker pain points are based on evidence-based research. For additional pain points, see [Facing a financial shock - Project one sheet](https://assets.performance.gov/cx/files/life-experiences/2022/CX-2022-Financial%20Shock%20Life%20Experience%20-%20Project%20One-Sheet.pdf).

## Applicant stories

Every year, [30% of the U.S. population participates](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/people-participate-social-safety-net) in a social safety net public benefit program like SNAP, WIC, Medicaid, and more. The clients of these programs count on their benefits being delivered quickly, easily, securely, and with a concern for their privacy. The following applicant stories are based on user personas from [Facing a financial shock - Project one sheet](https://assets.performance.gov/cx/files/life-experiences/2022/CX-2022-Financial%20Shock%20Life%20Experience%20-%20Project%20One-Sheet.pdf).

## Applicant pain points

- **No Phones:** 15% of the U.S. population doesn’t have a smartphone. Those without smartphones may rely on desktops or public resources, e.g. a library phone or a social worker’s phone. This may delay access to benefits. 
- **No Permanent Address:** Applicants who have experienced recent disasters or have reasons for unstable housing or lack housing may miss critical updates if they don’t update their address on file. 
- **Accessibility:** People with disabilities may rely on assistive technologies to navigate websites. Websites must be accessible for people with temporary or permanent disabilities.
- **Challenges with Technology:** If an applicant lost access to their original email used for the account, they may attempt to set up another account with a new email, resulting in duplicate accounts. This may delay their application review. They may experience frustration if they forget their recovery credentials (e.g. answers to security questions) when they are trying to complete tasks like password reset or multi-factor authentication. They may experience long wait times when trying to speak with a caseworker, or calling the call center, to resolve their account access issues.

## Caseworker Pain Points 

- **Understaffed:** Call centers may only handle a certain volume of calls at even given time. When applicants aren't able to complete their tasks through self-service, they are likely to turn to the call center to get human assistance. Caseworkers may experience a high volume of calls with password resets, especially during renewal periods. They may not be able to get to all the calls, which delays applications. Caseworkers may experience a high volume of calls with account access issues, if applicants lost access to their smartphone or email that originally used to set up multi-factor authentication methods. 
- **Unable to reach an applicant:** Caseworkers may have to devote additional time to resolve issues related to application delays due to the applicant’s contact information (e.g. mailing address) being out of date. 
- **Resolving duplicate account issues:** Caseworkers may devote resources to supporting applicants who created multiple accounts to apply for one benefit, which may delay access to benefits.
