## Intentional implementation of authentication and account creation speeds up application times and prevents administrative burden.
Digital authentication adds friction into the user experience. If imposed on the user at the wrong moments, it can lead to unnecessary applicant attrition and the failure to receive benefits, negatively impacting the overall mission of the program. 

## Minimize account creation and authentication as a barrier to application and accessing benefits.
As an analogy, state benefit systems might look to eCommerce experiences as a potential pattern. While making a purchase online, these sites minimize any user action that might distract a user from completing the purchase. Once that is done, they then often seek to establish a long term relationship by asking the user to create an account. Similarly, state benefit systems where possible should keep usersâ€™ attention on completing the initial application or step. After that is completed, then introduce accounts and establish why they are useful.
