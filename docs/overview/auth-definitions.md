PLACEHOLDER
This section provides context on authentication, especially for non-technical audiences, in order to help establish a common language that program and IT teams can use to discuss constraints and factors for consideration.

## Defining digital accounts

Digital accounts are online profiles that use a unique **identifier** — like a username or email address — to allow applicants to manage and track benefits through a self-service portal during account creation. Digital accounts can also establish a channel for communication between the state benefits agency and applicants, and allow for applicants to access their application, their profile, and their data within a benefits system. Combined with digital authentication methods, the use of digital accounts increases confidence that state programs are interacting with the intended beneficiary of their program. This helps the state reserve more resource-intensive channels e.g. phone support or in-person interactions for more challenging cases that can’t be addressed through a self-service portal, or for applicants who cannot or will not use digital channels for benefits application and access.

## Defining digital authentication

Digital authentication also known as Electronic Authentication (E-Authentication)  is designed to allow an approved user to demonstrate control of a digital account in an online system before granting that user access to the system, resources, or data. Authentication can help states: 

- protect applicants’ data
- ensure the right benefits get to the right person,
- reduce administrative burden to access benefits, and remain compliant with government regulations
- prevent fraud

In order to demonstrate control of an account, a user needs to authenticate their digital identity using an identifier, such as a username or email address, and one or more authentication factors. Factors can be described in three ways: 

- Something you know, like a password
- Something you have, like a phone
- Something you are, like a fingerprint

While the majority of digital accounts require a password as a single factor authentication method, many now are requiring additional factors such as, “Multi-factor Authentication” (MFA), which increases security, and improves compliance with specific federal and state regulations to achieve a higher level of security  MFA often involves sending a code via SMS to authenticate a user in their systems.

## Defining identity verification
Identity verification (IDV) is the process of identifying and confirming if a digital account holder is a real person. Along with digital authentication, identity verification is an essential technique for ensuring e that digital benefit applications grant the right person access to the right benefits. This involves verifying the accuracy and authenticity of personal information provided by an individual to ensure they are who they claim to be. Many benefit systems leverage identity verification as an additional anti-fraud tool: it builds trust by protecting users’ data and privacy, and aids in meeting compliance with government requirements to protect users’ data and prevent illegal illicit activities. Identity verification may increase administrative burden on the applicant. 


Identity verification is important, however, this playbook focuses on authentication and account creation.
