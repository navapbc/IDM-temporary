# Constraints & Considerations

State program administrators and IT delivery teams must balance many constraints and considerations to arrive at a user experience and technical system that satisfies all internal stakeholders and applicants:

## Usability
Applicants must be able to interact with digital systems in an intuitive way so they can quickly and easily apply and access their benefits to meet their needs. Authentication requirements are examples of intentional friction added to the user experience, in order to establish security and privacy for the applicant and program. 

## Trust
IT teams must ensure systems are secure in order to build trust with applicants that their data is secure. Some applicants may not trust the government with their data, so they may refrain from participating in multi-factor authentication methods like biometric data, or need plain language information that helps them understand why personal information is requested and how the program will keep their data safe.

## Security
Benefit programs disburse millions of dollars every year. Ensuring the right benefits go to the right applicant is a core part of the mission. 

## Legacy technology
Programs and IT teams can also be encumbered by existing legacy technology that may not always support the “best practice” implementation. In the short term, programs and IT teams must work together to make improvements where possible, while considering long-term modernization. 

## Regulation
Programs and IT teams balance regulation and guidance from a number of issuing parties, both at the Federal and state level. This guidance can often be in conflict with one another or prioritize different tradeoffs and outcomes than what the program may desire. 

## Costs
Often programs turn to third-party authentication technology to solve these needs. Contracts and licensing costs impose direct and indirect costs and friction on decisions in this area.

## Change management
Migrating applicants and systems to new experiences or requirements can also be a process challenge that transcends technology. 

## Privacy
Benefit programs hold a significant amount of sensitive personal information that must be protected from bad actors.
