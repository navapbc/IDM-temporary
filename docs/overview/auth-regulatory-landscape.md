# The Regulatory Landscape

There are a number of government institutions who set standards and requirements for identity management. A full landscape is available on [IDManagement.gov](https://www.idmanagement.gov/university/policymap/). This playbook focuses on guidance provided from these sources as most relevant to the benefits delivery space: 

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
NIST provides guidelines and standards for identity verification and authentication, including the Digital Identity Guidelines (NIST Special Publication 800-63) that offer best practices for identity proofing and authentication. 

## Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
CMS issues guidance that is applicable to state Medicaid programs. In particular, MARS-E establishes requirements for state Medicaid programs to verify the identity of applicants and applicants to prevent fraud and ensure program integrity.

## USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
FNS administers programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and requires states to verify the identities of applicants and applicants to prevent fraud and ensure program integrity. 

## White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Executive branch guidance issued through circulars and memoranda. OMB guidance often sets the long-term direction and strategy for federal agencies, rather than prescriptive implementation guidance. States are not required to follow OMB guidance. It may inform their own technical strategies. 

## State requirements
Each state may have additional regulations or guidance regarding identity management for various purposes, including government services, financial transactions, and healthcare.

## Strategies for Navigating Conflicting Requirements (Dunno if I love this here, might be a sub-page)
Policies and regulations issued by regulatory organizations can vary and may conflict, which creates confusion for state agencies to determine what, when and how to implement authentication for state digital benefit applications. In addition to the guidance in this playbook, there are more formal strategies that states can consider in order to navigate conflicting requirements: 

- **Compliance Audit:** Conduct a regular audit to ensure implementation meets government requirements for identity verification, and by balancing security and equity

- **Risk Assessment:** Follow the NIST guidance for determining the appropriate level of assurance to reduce risk of bad actors accessing applicantâ€™s benefits, without overly securing systems to the point of reducing access to benefits

- **Consultation with Policy Experts:** Seeking guidance to navigate complex regulatory landscapes and resolve conflicts or interpret ambiguities in regulations

- **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:** Continuous monitoring of evolving regulations and requirements can help state benefit programs adapt quickly to ensure ongoing compliance

By understanding the regulatory landscape and adopting a proactive approach to compliance, state benefit programs can effectively navigate conflicts among regulations and requirements while maintaining compliance with applicable laws and standards. Additionally, we illustrate when and how states can implement authentication and account creation with a balanced approach to security, compliance and user requirements in the following section.
