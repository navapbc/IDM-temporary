State benefit delivery departments play a vital role in improving the efficacy of their benefits programs. Their considerations must reconcile tensions between legislation, policy guidance, and technical implementation, among many factors

## The context

Every year, 30% of the U.S. population participates in a social safety net public benefit program like SNAP, WIC, Medicaid, and more1. The clients of these programs count on their benefits being delivered quickly, easily, securely, and with a concern for their privacy. 

State benefit delivery departments play a vital role in improving the efficacy of their benefits programs. Their considerations must reconcile tensions between legislation, policy guidance, and technical implementation, among many factors.  

State Information Technology (IT) departments play a key role in developing the technical infrastructure that ensures that benefits are delivered to the right people. Among the most effective digital tools for enhancing privacy and security are Identity Management Systems (IdM). IdMs allow government service providers to ensure that only authenticated applicants can access critical benefit-delivery systems and optionally verify the identity of benefit applicants if necessary.  

However, implementation of these identity privacy and security measures are regulated by a complex and often-conflicting set of policy requirements from varying state and Federal authorities, and it can be expensive to deploy and maintain while remaining in compliance. More critically, they can come at an immense cost to usability and impose a substantial burden on applicants, often restricting access digital benefits systems. Benefit program staff often do not have the technical knowledge needed to make informed decisions about the trade-offs of usability and security. This impacts their ability to effectively deliver on their mission, leading to inter-departmental frustration and confusion.

## It's critical to get this right

This playbook aims to help state benefit agencies explore usable, secure, and reliable ways for applicants to apply for and access benefits, with a focus on SNAP and Medicaid to start. 

Through this work, we hope to demystify policy and compliance requirements and set up benefit program delivery staff and their IT partners to have well-informed conversations about authentication and digital account creation that balance security and privacy concerns with burden reduction and usability. 

Building out a strong, usable authentication system is a long process. Some state agencies may be well on their way towards this goal while others are just getting started. 

In this document, we’ll propose a range of best practices for authentication and account creation processes drawn from our experience working with state benefits programs and identity management systems. We’ll walk through the tradeoffs of different considerations, allowing you to select the methods that work best for your context in terms of available technical resources, policy and compliance requirements, budgetary constraints, and organizational configuration. 

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to the challenges presented by identity management. Our goal is that by the end of this playbook, state program delivery departments and their IT implementation partners will be able to identify the approaches that best work for their specific situations and constraints.

## Going forward

This version of this playbook begins with an examination of digital account creation and authentication in the context of SNAP and Medicaid. In the future, we hope to create additional guidance on digital identity verification in the benefits space.
