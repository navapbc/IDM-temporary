# Introduction
{: .fs-9 }

This playbook aims to help state program delivery and information technology (IT) teams to:
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
* Understand and demystify federal guidance on authentication and digital account creation
* Have informed conversations to identify approaches to authentication and digital account creation that balance usability, security, reliability, and equity for applicants applying for and accessing their SNAP and Medicaid benefits.

## Background

Implementing public benefits is critical to the health and safety of millions of Americans across the country.

To implement these critical systems, state benefit delivery departments work to improve the effectiveness of their benefits programs by balancing regulations, policy guidelines, technical implementation, and other factors. They work in tandem with state information technology (IT) departments who play a key role in developing the technical infrastructure that supports and enables benefits delivery to state constituents.

Identity management systems (IDMs) sit at the heart of benefits delivery, ensuring that benefits are delivered to the right people at the right time through tools like digital authentication and account creation. These tools have a complex and sometimes conflicting set of policy requirements from state and federal agencies that can make them difficult to implement.

## How to use this playbook

This playbook contains best practices and concrete recommendations for digital authentication and account creation in public benefits applications that aim to prioritize equitable and accessible design while maintaining or enhancing security compliance and privacy for applicants. 

Building out a strong, usable authentication and account creation system is a long process. Some state agencies may be well on their way towards this goal while others are just getting started. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to the challenges presented by identity management, and we aim to support agencies at each stage of the journey though this playbook, which is divided into two sections plus an appendix:

* The **Authentication & Account Creation Overview** section (link to section header) illustrates key concepts on authentication and account creation, a mapping of the federal regulatory landscape for identity management in SNAP and Medicaid, and a description of key constraints in the guidance provided by those regulations.
* The **Best Practices for Authentication Setup and Account Creation** section (link to section header) renders policy guidance into a series of descriptive workflows and user experience design components that can help benefit delivery programs and IT staff to create digital experiences that balance security, usability, equity, and compliance.
* The **Appendix** (link to section header) contains supplemental information on benefit service delivery from a variety of states, including screenshots of authentication and account creation workflows.

By the end of this playbook, state program delivery agencies and their IT implementation partners will be able to identify the approaches that work best for their circumstances, taking into account their technical resources, federal and state policy requirements, budgetary constraints, and organizational configuration.

## Approach
To develop this playbook, [Facing Financial Shock](https://www.performance.gov/cx/life-experiences/facing-a-financial-shock/) synthesized information from a number of sources:

* Reviewed a sample of digital state benefit systems and their identity management workflows
* Examined federal regulations on authentication and account creation, including guidance issued by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), CMCS, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and the White House
* Interviewed state-level benefits program administrators and IT staff about their first-hand experiences with digital authentication systems
* Reviewed the playbook with a sample of state benefits program and IT staff

## Going forward
This playbook is an analysis of account creation and initial authentication setup for digital SNAP and Medicaid benefit applications. Future versions of the playbook may address authentication management or digital identity verification in the benefits space.
